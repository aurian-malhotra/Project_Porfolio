Showcasing technical projects in Aerospace Engineering

## About Me
Hi, I'm Aurian Malhotra, a 4th-year Aerospace Engineering student at UC Davis. I have a strong background in stability analysis and dynamic simulations but am still exploring my career path. Currently, I'm most excited about rocket propulsion and applied aerodynamics. This repository showcases my engineering projects, including MATLAB simulations, CAD models, circuit designs, and experimental results.
