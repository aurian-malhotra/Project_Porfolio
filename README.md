Showcasing technical projects in Aerospace Engineering

## About Me
Hi, I'm Aurian Malhotra, a 4th-year Aerospace Engineering student at UC Davis. I have a strong background in stability analysis and dynamic simulations but am still exploring my career path. Currently, I'm most excited about rocket propulsion and applied aerodynamics. This repository showcases my engineering projects, including MATLAB simulations, CAD models, circuit designs, and experimental results.

### Electronic Circuits and Systems (Circuits II)
In ENG 100, I gained hands-on experience with analog and digital circuits, focusing on both signal processing and circuit design. A key component of the course was learning how to use important electrical engineering equipment such as the digital multimeter, waveform function generator, and oscilloscope. These tools were essential for analyzing and testing various circuits throughout the course.

*Key Labs*
Band-Pass Filter Design:
The objective of this lab was to create a band-pass filter and analyze its effect on an input signal. This involved configuring multiple op-amps and capacitors to form a combination of low-pass and high-pass filters, allowing the circuit to pass a range of frequencies while filtering out those outside this range. Measurements of the output voltage, gain, time delay, and phase were made across various frequencies, and we confirmed that the filter successfully passed the desired frequencies while attenuating others. A significant part of the process involved troubleshooting the multi-stage filter design to ensure proper performance for both the low-pass and high-pass components before combining them.

Lightmeter System:
I designed and implemented a lightmeter system using a Raspberry Pi Pico and associated components. The system integrated a Wheatstone bridge and an RC low-pass filter to measure light intensity, providing real-time data on a 7-segment display.
